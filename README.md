# The Practice of Verilog
## Introduction
* [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) is a collection of small circuit design exercises for practicing digital hardware design using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL).  
* Here I will show my answers for this exercises, they are all successful in [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page)'s simulation.
## Topic
The exercises in [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) are divided into:

* Getting Started

* Verilog Language

* Combinational Logic

* Sequential Logic

* Reading Simulations

* Writing Testbenches
